This web application compresses images using one of the classic algorithms of Linear Algebra viz. 'Singular Value Decomposition'.

The application let's user upload an image for compression and outputs a zip file that contains
1. Matrix U
2. Matrix S (Sigma from research papers)
3. Matrix V
4. Reconstructed image using matrices U, S, V

Users can use these matrices and decide upon the number of eigenvalues needed and thereby reconstruct their own (approximated) image.
